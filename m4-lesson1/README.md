# Module 4 - Consuming the API from AngularJS

## Lesson 1: The UI Project and Basic REST from AngularJS


To see the features in action you'll have to:

1- run the <em>um-webapp</em> application
2- run the <em>um-ui</em> application
3- browse <em>http://localhost:8083</em>

Note: some static <em>um-ui</em> resources are added by the wro4j plugin in the generate-resources phase. If you run this application directly from the IDE, this phase might not be executed, and therefore you'll have to execute it manually. In Eclipse, for example, you can right-click on the project > Run As > Maven build > set 'package' as the maven goal.
